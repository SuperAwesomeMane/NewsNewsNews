                <h3>Semi-automatic rifle announced for commemorative legislative firearm</h3>
                <img class="newsImage" src="http://www.sltrib.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=6ilw1$k7ZcnyfdizMSxyjc$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYsf9Bl68wgDYV2kuSYzIy0mWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg">

                <p>Not even joking here. Utah legislators are ordering a specially manufactured edition of the AR-15, created by Tegra Arms. The firearm is carbon fiver, with the state motto "industry" along with a beehive emblazoned on the side. Additionally, a honeybee and the motto of the Utah House, "Vox Populi", is etched onto the stock.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The cost for legislators to buy this rifle is $650.</li>
                        <li>For the price of $750, 250 of these guns are available to the public, with $100 (of each purchase) going to the Gun Safety Alliance for children's gun safety education.</li>
                        <li>The firearm's bullets are about 1/4th inch in diameter, and travels at about 3,000 feet per second, and typically packed into 30-round magazines.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Previous legislative firearms have included the semi-automatic Glock 19, the Browning 1911 (designated the state's OFFICIAL firearm with a legislative logo on the handle itself), and a North American Arms .22-caliber revolver. We are not joking. Unless the Salt Lake Tribune is joking, this is a real story.
