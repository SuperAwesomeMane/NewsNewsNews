        <h3>Dinosaur forced to RETIRE from the Natural History Museum as it's 'not relevant'</h3>
        <p>The plaster dinosaur skeleton has been a fixture of the London museum for 109 years but is not considered relevant enough to what is happening to the natural world today.</p>
        <p>So from summer 2017, he will be replaced by the 83 foot long (25.2 metres) real skeleton of a blue whale, suspended and "diving" from the ceiling of the Hintze Hall.</p>
